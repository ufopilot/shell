GNU awk

The inplace extension emulates GNU sed’s -i option, which performs “in-place” editing of each input file. It uses the bundled inplace.awk include file to invoke the extension properly. source

awk -i inplace '{print $2*3}' file 
To keep a backup copy of the original file, try this:

awk -i inplace -v inplace::suffix=.bak '{print $2*3}' file
